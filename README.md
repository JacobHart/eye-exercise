# Eyes
## Description
<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>

In the original exercise a single eye was supplied and we had to make a pair of eyes. The eyes follow the cursor in the screen. In order to further improve on this exercise a new pair of eyes is periodicly added to the screen on a random location. After 3 pairs of eyes the screen becomes too full and the first pair of eyes is removed. 


## How to run
There are no dependencies. This should run inside the browser without the need for a proxy server

## Roadmap of future improvements
At this moment the position of the cursor relative to the center of the screen is used to update the eye movement. An improvement whould be if the position of the cursor relative to the eyeball whould be used to update the eye movement.
